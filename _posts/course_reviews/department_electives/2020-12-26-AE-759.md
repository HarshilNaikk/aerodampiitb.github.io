# 2021
### Prof. Hemendra Arya
**Author**: Anmol Harshana

**Pre-requisite courses**: None

**Pre-requisite skills**: None

**Course Content**:
"Covered: Systems definitions and concepts. Conceptual system design; Introduction to engineering design and decision making; Requirements capture; Requirements analysis, functional decomposition; System architecture;   Engineering systems modeling. Analysis of system: Reliability; Maintainability; Serviceability; Disposability and Affordability. Cost and benefit analysis. Methods of decision analysis; State transition matrix models;  System life-cycle modeling, engineering systems design and operation;.
Use of systems engineering software to capture the systems engineering process.

Not covered but listed initially: Quality Function Deployment; Queuing theory; Design options; Monte Carlo modeling; Utility theory; Forecasting. Modeling the research and development process; Information,  Programme management with case studies, Game theory; "

**Evaluation Structure**:
The batch was divided into teams of 3 to 4 people. Each team had to choose one problem statement for project and then work on it for the entire sem. The evaluation structure was as follows: Individual: (midsem + endsem ): 20+30. Group: (Project + Assignments): 30+20

**Motivation to take up the course**: 
My motivation to take the course was to learn more about how real world engineering problems are tackled successfully at a broader level.

**Information about Projects/Assignments**: 
The entire batch was divided into teams of 3 to 4 people. Each team had to choose it's own problem statement for the project subject to some constraints. The entire systems engineering flow had to be applied on the chosen problem statement insync with the lectures. The assignments also had to be done in team within a deadline of one to two weeks and were quite helpful in understanding some of the concepts. 

**Quizzes/Midsem/Endsem papers Difficulty**: 3/5

**Overall Course Difficulty**: Moderate

**Average Time Commitment**:
4 hours per week. Most of the time outside lectures was spent on group project and assignments.

**Attendance Policy**: No min threshold was there, however you have to be present in class during presentations.

---

**General Fundae**:
The theory part of the course seems easy but to do the group project and assignments properly, a good amount of time is required. So if you feel that you are already packed with other commitments, then don't take this course. Try to be active in class (online lectures are boring otherwise) and have lots of discussion with your team on the concepts to learn more.

**Feedback on Lectures**:
The lectures felt more interesting when you were actively interacting. Otherwise, lectures felt boring. Professor Arya is a brilliant teacher who can give you very good examples and explanations if you ask for it. I would say his questions and feedback on your work were quite  valuable and you learn the most when you apply the SE processes yourself in the project. 


**Should you do this course?**: 
Anyone with enthusiasm to learn more about how engineering systems are developed and good practices for the same.

### Prof. Hemendra Arya
**Author**: Soham Shirish Phanse

**Pre-requisite courses**: None

**Pre-requisite skills**: None

**Course Content**:
Basics of Systems Engineering, System Life cycle, Committed costs vs Timeline basics, Techniques of system engineering management, Concept, Development, Utilization, Support and Disposal phases of system, Roles of System Engineer, System of Systems, Systems Engineering Processes, Business or Mission Analysis Process, Stakeholder requirements capture and analysis, System requirements definition, System hierarchy, Architecture definition process, Design Definition Process, System Analysis process, Implementation process, Integration, Verification, Transition, Validation, Operation, Maintenance, Disposal etc., Arcadia, Capella implementation.

**Evaluation Structure**:
"Midsems 20, Endsems 30, Course project (team) - 40, Peer Evaluation - 10
The exams were on the easier side, however a lot of effort was required for the course project, where we had to apply the system engineering concept to a system of your choice"

**Motivation to take up the course**: 
I wanted to learn and explore how complex systems like satellites, launch vehicles are designed and how such complex and concurrent processes are managed. It was coupled with the interest because of working in a team for a project. This course is extremely necessary for someone to understand design thinking. Arya Sir teaches extremely well. It is very important to put enough amount of effort in the project since a lot of discussions in teams is required. 

---

**Information about Projects/Assignments**: 
The course had a capstone kind of project where we had to apply all the system engineering concepts to a real system of our own choice. It is to be done in teams with discussions, brainstorming, we had to start from requirements and go unto the verification and validation processes. 

**Quizzes/Midsem/Endsem papers Difficulty**: 3/5

**Overall Course Difficulty**: Moderate

**Average Time Commitment**:
An hour per week initially, later on as the course project progresses about 3-4 hours per week apart from lectures

**Attendance Policy**: 
Sir didn't enforce any attendance policy - however Sir taught extremely well in lectures and also discussed about concepts in detail - gave intuitive examples, all-in-all sir taught very well, hence it is highly advisable to attend 'ALL' the lectures

---

**General Fundae**:
This course must be taken only if you have deep interest in the topic, because it can get monotonic and one can loose grip[ very easily, hence the advise would be think twice before doing the course.

**Feedback on Lectures**:
Prof. Arya sir teaches extremely well, he gives very nice r4al world examples to make students understand the concept, he also gives extra time if requested for any doubts, project review etc. All in all the Professor puts in more than sufficient effort and is very nice in teaching as well as other aspects. 

**Should you do this course?**: 
Ideally this course is designed for upper classmen i.e. in the 3rd year or beyond their study. However this year, Sir also allowed a few sophomores to do it. It may differ from year to year. The courser doesn't have any official prerequisite skills and courses hence syllabus wise anyone can handle it. However upper classmen, as mentioned above will benefit more from doing this course.
