**General funda**:

This course will be one of the chill courses among others in your 3rd sem. The prof's teaching style is excellent and has good research experience in the field. You should interact with the prof as much as possible during lectures. Apart from the course material, the prof likes to share Aero trivia with students, which is why the live sessions are so interesting. The Homework problems are very easy, they are mostly formula-plug-and-solve type questions. The midsem was almost similar, with few questions requiring some thinking. The endsem was moderately difficult and lengthy, but it accounts for 50% weightage, so its not unreasonable. 


**Professor's Teaching Style**: 

The course content is easy to understand and the prof's teaching style is amazing. He used to send the links to his lectures uploaded on CDEEP from 3-4 years ago, and then do a quick revision during the live slots which reinforced the concepts pretty well. He tried to interact with everyone during the live lectures and had interesting discussions on related/unrelated topics. 


**Information regarding assignments/projects**:

"The project logistics are given sometime after the midsem. Student teams of 4 members each. The prof suggests 3-4 topics for the students to choose from. The students can suggest a topic of their own too. 

The course project is very suitable for this course. Since most of the course and assignments are theory, applying the concepts learnt in class for doing engine analysis (or anything else) really brings everything together. Also for many people this is the first time they work in a team for 2-3 weeks, so that is a good experience too. "


**Should you do this course?**: 

Core course for Aero sophies. Basic course in thermo and propulsion, required as a prerequisite for other courses later on.
